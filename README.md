Power Breakout
---------------

Ever wanted to prototype a circuit for your Eurorack but didn't have a benchtop power supply for testing? Worry no more! With this small crouton (and an extra long ribbon cable) you can plug your breadboard into your rack as though it were a module.

The crouton includes twin LEDs to show that the 12 volt rails are hot, load smoothing capactiors and resistors. Use a jumper to select between 5 volts and ground on the +12 volt side.

The board can be [ordered directly from OSHpark via this shared project](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/9Uiejhik).


## Vendors

There are part numbers in the [BOM](vco.csv) for many of the parts (not for basic passives though) at the following vendors:

* [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com): Needs no introduction. Get your ICs from here (or [digikey](https://www.digikey.com)).
* [Tayda Electronics](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/): Good supplier for passive components; audio jacks, and potentiometers. Their audio jacks are slightly smaller than the thonkiconn from thonk.
* [Thonk](https://www.thonk.co.uk/): The only place I've found tempco resistors for sale! You're looking for the 1k resistor, their store doesn't support part number searches.
* [Love My Switches](https://lovemyswitches.com/): Has [really good knobs](https://lovemyswitches.com/anodized-aluminum-knob-the-lo-fi-1-4-smooth-shaft-12-5mm-od/) to go on those potentiometers!
* [OSHPark](https://oshpark.com/): Fast and (relatively) cheap PCB manufacturer. [The V1 circuit](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/N1VjtYdp) works well, but you'll have to file down the toggle switch legs to fit the tiny through holes on the board.
